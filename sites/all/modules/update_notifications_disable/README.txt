Drupal 6.x core provides a new module called 'Update status' which provides
update notifications when new versions of core or contributed modules and
themes are available.

If for some reason you do not want to enable this functionalilty (for example,
you have privacy concerns, or you plan to handle your own system updates (e.g.
for a multisite install), you can use this module to turn off the warning that
appears in the administration panel when Update status module is disabled.

This module has absolutely no functionality; it simply disables the warning.

To install:
- Place the module in your sites/all/modules directory.
- Enable it from Administer >> Site building >> Modules.
